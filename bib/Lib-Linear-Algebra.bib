		The commutation matrix $\mathbf{K}$ 
		is defined as a square matrix 
		containing only zeroes and ones. 
		Its main properties are that 
		it transforms $\mathrm{vec} \mathbf{A}$ into $\mathrm{vec} \mathbf{A}^{\prime}$, 
		and that it reverses the order of a Kronecker product. 
		An analytic expression for $\mathbf{K}$ 
		is given and many further properties are derived. 
		Subsequently, 
		these properties are applied to some problems 
		connected with the normal distribution. 
		The expectation is derived of
		$
		\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{\prime}
		\mathbf{A}
		\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
		\cdot
		\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{\prime}
		\mathbf{B}
		\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
		\cdot
		\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{\prime}
		\mathbf{C}
		\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
		$, 
		where 
		$
		\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} 
		\sim 
		\mathcal{N} 
		\left(0, \mathbf{V} \right)
		$, and 
		$
		\mathbf{A}, 
		\mathbf{B}, 
		\mathbf{C}
		$ 
		are symmetric. 
		Further, 
		the expectation and covariance matrix of 
		$
		x \otimes y
		$ are found, where $x$ and $y$ are normally distributed dependent variables.
		Finally,
		the variance matrix of the (noncentral) Wishart distribution is derived.

		Two transformation matrices are introduced, 
		$\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{D}$, 
		which contain zero and unit elements only. 
		If $\mathbf{A}$ is an arbitrary $( n,n )$ matrix, 
		$\mathbf{L}$ eliminates from $\mathrm{vec} \mathbf{A}$ 
		the supradiagonal elements of $\mathbf{A}$, 
		while $\mathbf{D}$ performs the inverse transformation 
		for $\mathrm{symmetric} \mathbf{A}$. 
		Many properties of $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ are derived, 
		in particular in relation to Kronecker products. 
		The usefulness of the two matrices is demonstrated 
		in three areas of mathematical statistics and matrix algebra: 
		maximum likelihood estimation of the multivariate normal distribution, 
		the evaluation of Jacobians of transformations
		with symmetric or lower triangular matrix arguments, 
		and the solution of matrix equations.
