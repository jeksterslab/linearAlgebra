		A brand new, 
		fully updated edition 
		of a popular classic on matrix differential calculus 
		with applications in statistics and econometrics.
		 
		This exhaustive, 
		self-contained book on matrix theory 
		and matrix differential calculus 
		provides a treatment of matrix calculus 
		based on differentials 
		and shows how easy it is to use this theory 
		once you have mastered the technique. 
		Jan Magnus, 
		who, 
		along with the late Heinz Neudecker, 
		pioneered the theory, 
		develops it further in this new edition 
		and provides many examples along the way to support it.
		 
		Matrix calculus has become an essential tool 
		for quantitative methods in a large number of applications, 
		ranging from social and behavioral sciences to econometrics. 
		It is still relevant and used today 
		in a wide range of subjects 
		such as the biosciences and psychology. 
		Matrix Differential Calculus 
		with Applications in Statistics and Econometrics, 
		Third Edition 
		contains all of the essentials 
		of multivariable calculus with an emphasis on the use of differentials. 
		It starts by presenting a concise, 
		yet thorough overview of matrix algebra, 
		then goes on to develop the theory of differentials. 
		The rest of the text combines the theory and application 
		of matrix differential calculus, 
		providing the practitioner 
		and researcher with both a quick review and a detailed reference.
		 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Fulfills the need for an updated and unified treatment of matrix differential calculus
			\item Contains many new examples and exercises based on questions asked of the author over the years
			\item Covers new developments in field and features new applications
			\item Written by a leading expert and pioneer of the theory
			\item Part of the Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics 
		\end{itemize}
		 
		Matrix Differential Calculus 
		With Applications 
		in Statistics and Econometrics 
		Third Edition 
		is an ideal text for graduate students 
		and academics studying the subject, 
		as well as for postgraduates 
		and specialists working in biosciences and psychology.

		Matrix Algebra is the first volume of the Econometric Exercises Series. 
		It contains exercises relating to course material 
		in matrix algebra that students are expected to know 
		while enrolled in an (advanced) undergraduate 
		or a postgraduate course in econometrics or statistics. 
		The book contains a comprehensive collection of exercises, 
		all with full answers. 
		But the book is not just a collection of exercises; 
		in fact, 
		it is a textbook, 
		though one that is organized in a completely different manner 
		than the usual textbook. 
		The volume can be used either as a self-contained course 
		in matrix algebra or as a supplementary text.
